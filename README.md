# Headings  
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

# Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote


Quoted text is indented with a vertical line on the left and displayed using gray type.

# Color using LaTEX
$\color{red}{Your \space text \space here}$

**Note**: You must use \space because LaTeX ignores standard spaces.
