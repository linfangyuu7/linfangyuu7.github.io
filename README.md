# Headings  
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

# Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote


Quoted text is indented with a vertical line on the left and displayed using gray type.

# Supported color models
Yu can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.

Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how HEX values within backticks create small circles of color, here white and then black.
